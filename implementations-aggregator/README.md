Kata Roman Numerals
===================

This project aggregates all my attemps in different language.

One complete but abstract test suite is written using JUnit in the src/test/java directory.
If you want to test your implementation, you just have to create a class that implements the RomanNumeralsConverter interface and a test class that extends AbstractRomanNumeralsKataTest.
