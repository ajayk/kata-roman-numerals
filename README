Kata Roman Numerals
===================

This is my attempt on the [Roman Numerals code kata](http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?KataRomanNumerals) in different languages.

Description
-----------

The Kata says you should write a function to convert from normal numbers to Roman Numerals. The reference documentation that shall be used is available [here](http://www.novaroma.org/via_romana/numbers.html) with an implementation in Javascript.

Test cases
----------

To assert that the function is correctly implemented, the following groups of tests cases may be used.

The first group focus only on one-digit numbers (only units). The second group focus on two-digits numbers, and more importantly introduce more symbols. The third test verifies that all possible symbols are handled. Finally, the fourth group contains the most complicated test, which is the acceptance test.

### 1 - Test units tokens

First group of tests to ensure that the simple numbers are correctly handled. The function must convert the following numbers :

    1 -> I
    2 -> II
    3 -> III
    4 -> IV
    5 -> V
    6 -> VI
    7 -> VII
    8 -> VIII
    9 -> IX

### 2 - Test tens tokens

    10 -> X
    20 -> XX
    30 -> XXX
    40 -> XL
    50 -> L
    60 -> LX
    70 -> LXX
    80 -> LXXX
    90 -> XC
    11 -> XI
    12 -> XII
    13 -> XIII
    14 -> XIV
    15 -> XV
    16 -> XVI
    17 -> XVII
    18 -> XVIII
    19 -> XIX

### 3 - Test all tokens

    1 -> I
    5 -> V
    10 -> X
    50 -> L
    100 -> C
    500 -> D
    1000 -> M

### 4 - Test that complex cases are handled (Acceptance tests)

    42 -> XLII
    89 -> LXXXIX
    99 -> XCIX
    111 -> CXI
    1999 -> MCMXCIX
